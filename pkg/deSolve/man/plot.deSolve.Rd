 Plot, Image and Histogram Method for deSolve Objects
}
\description{
Plot the output of numeric integration routines.
}
\usage{
\method{plot}{deSolve}(x, ..., which = NULL, ask = NULL, obs = NULL, 
  obspar = list())
\method{hist}{deSolve}(x, which = 1:(ncol(x)-1), ask = NULL, ...)
\method{image}{deSolve}(x, which = NULL, ask = NULL, 
  add.contour = FALSE, grid = NULL, method = "image", legend = FALSE, 
  ...)  
\method{subset}{deSolve}(x, subset = NULL, select= NULL,
  which = select, \dots)

plot.1D (x, which = NULL, ask = NULL, grid = NULL, xyswap = FALSE, ...) 
}

\arguments{
  \item{x }{an object of class \code{deSolve}, as returned by the
    integrators, and to be plotted.
    
    For \code{plot.deSolve}, it is allowed to pass several objects of class
    \code{deSolve} after \code{x} (unnamed) - see second example.
    }

  \item{which }{the name(s) or the index to the variables that should be
    plotted or selected.  Default = all variables, except \code{time}. }

  \item{select }{which variable/columns to be selected.
  }
  \item{subset }{logical expression indicating elements or rows to keep in 
    \code{select}: missing values are taken as \code{false}
  }
  \item{ask }{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the user is \emph{ask}ed before
    each plot, if \code{NULL} the user is only asked if more than one
    page of plots is necessary and the current graphics device is set
    interactive, see \code{\link{par}(ask=.)} and
    \code{\link{dev.interactive}}.}
  
  \item{add.contour }{if \code{TRUE}, will add contours to the image plot.}

  \item{method }{the name of the plotting method to use, one of "image", 
    "filled.contour", "persp", "contour".}

  \item{grid }{only for \code{image} plots and for \code{plot.1D}: 
    the 1-D grid as a vector (for output generated with \code{ode.1D}), 
    or the x- and y-grid, as a \code{list} (for output generated with 
    \code{ode.2D}).}

  \item{xyswap }{ if \code{TRUE}, then x-and y-values are swapped and the 
    y-axis is from top to bottom. Useful for drawing vertical profiles.}

  \item{obs }{a \code{data.frame} or \code{matrix} with "observed data" that 
    will be added as \code{points} to the plots. \code{obs} can also be a 
    \code{list} with multiple data.frames and/or matrices containing 
    observed data.
    
    By default the first column of an observed data set should contain 
    the \code{time}-variable. An exception is when the first column of 
    \code{obs} consists of factors, or characters (strings).
    Then it is assumed that the data are presented in long (database) format,
    where the first three columns contain (name, time, y).  
    
    If \code{obs} is not \code{NULL} and \code{which} is \code{NULL}, 
    then the variables, common to both \code{obs} and \code{x} will be plotted.


  }
  \item{obspar }{additional graphics arguments passed to \code{points}, for 
    plotting the observed data. If \code{obs} is a \code{list} containing multiple
    observed data sets, then the graphics arguments can be  a vector
    or a list (e.g. for \code{xlim}, \code{ylim}), specifying each data set 
    separately.
  }
  \item{legend }{if \code{TRUE}, a color legend will be drawn on the right 
    of each image.
  }
  \item{\dots}{additional arguments.
  
    The graphical arguments are passed to
    \code{\link{plot.default}}, \code{\link{image}} or \code{\link{hist}} 

    For \code{plot.deSolve}, the dots may contain other objects of class 
    \code{deSolve}, as returned by the integrators, and 
    to be plotted on the same graphs as \code{x}  - see second example.
    In this case, \code{x} and and these other objects should be compatible, 
    i.e. the column names should be the same.
    
    For \code{plot.deSolve}, the arguments after \ldots must be matched exactly.     
  } 
}

\details{
  The number of panels per page is automatically determined up to 3 x 3
  (\code{par(mfrow = c(3, 3))}). This default can be overwritten by
  specifying user-defined settings for \code{mfrow} or \code{mfcol}.
  Set \code{mfrow} equal to \code{NULL} to avoid the plotting function to 
  change user-defined \code{mfrow} or \code{mfcol} settings.

  Other graphical parameters can be passed as well. Parameters
  are vectorized, either according to the number of plots 
  (\code{xlab, ylab}, \code{main, sub}, \code{xlim, ylim}, \code{log},
   \code{asp, ann, axes, frame.plot},\code{panel.first,panel.last},
   \code{cex.lab,cex.axis,cex.main}) or 
  according to the number of lines within one plot (other parameters 
  e.g. \code{col}, \code{lty}, \code{lwd} etc.) so it is possible to
  assign specific axis labels to individual plots, resp. different plotting 
  style. Plotting parameter \code{ylim}, or \code{xlim} can also be a list 
  to assign different axis limits to individual plots.
  
  Similarly, the graphical parameters for observed data, as passed by 
  \code{obspar} can be vectorized, according to the number of observed 
  data sets.
  
  Image plots will only work for 1-D and 2-D variables, as solved with
  \code{\link{ode.1D}} and \code{\link{ode.2D}}. In the first case, an
  image with \code{times} as x- and \code{the grid} as y-axis will be
  created.  in second case, an x-y plot will be created, for all
  times. Unless \code{ask = FALSE}, the user will be asked to confirm
  page changes.  For images, it is possible to pass an argument
  \code{method} which can take the values "image" (default),
  "filled.contour", "contour" or "persp", in order to use the respective
  plotting method.
  
  \code{plot} will always have \code{times} on the x-axis. For problems
  solved with \code{ode.1D}, it may be more useful to use \code{plot.1D}
  which will plot how spatial variables change with time. These plots will
  have the \code{grid} on the x-axis.

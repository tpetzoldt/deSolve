## KS -->ThPe: check interpolation in runge-kuttas.
##             rk_r and rk not the same (for zooplankton example)

## ThPe --> ??
 - "diagnostics" has not very clear structure
   We may ?? go to S3, e.g type -> class
   Note that one out can have several simultanaeous S3 classes,
   something like:

   class(out) <- c("matrix", "deSolve", "deSolvelsoda")

## KS --> Thpe:
   AGREED

   => diagnostics.lsoda and diagnostics.vode etc...
   but what if we have transformed to data.frame. Do we need to define diagnostics.data.frame?

##

   
 - provide additional "diagnostics" for runge-kutta functions:
    - size of time step
    - number of rejected steps


## ThPe -> ThPe

- implement PID step control

- implement alternatives for function maxerr

- ensure at least 4 internal steps for rk methods!! (Neville-Aitken)
  hmax = tmax - tmin / 4 (or better 5?)
  - done, but can be improved
  
- modularize rk_auto ?

- check logic of hini, hmax, hmin
  - especially for rk4 !!

- write special version for euler (speedup)

## ThPe --> KS 

- adapt vignette that rk now supports DLL models
## KS:
- DONE

Changes version 1.10-1
==========================



Changes version 1.10
==========================
Karline:
  compiled code using mass in daspk

Thomas:
  cleanEventTimes

Changes version 1.9+
==========================
Karline:
  roots, events, lags in radau
  roots in lsodes
  lags in daspk
  ode (method = "iteration")

Changes version 1.9
==========================
(Thomas + Karline)

summary.deSolve
subset.deSolve
plotting deSolve objects improved:
   -> plot more than one output in same figures (scenarios), 
   -> add observations
vignette improved

fixed bug in 'timesteps'
Timesteps OK if called outside of ODE

Changes version 1.8.1:
==========================
fixed compiler warnings using valgrind (Thomas and Karline)
fixed compiler warning C-code (Woody)

Changes version 1.8 Thomas:
==========================
dopri8(7)
- coefficients use now common instead of decimal fractions


Changes version 1.8 Karline:
============================
Runge-kuttas:
1. extra output: number of failed steps (see also 2)
2. number of function evaluations + 1 for initial condition
3. dense output for cash-karp
4. dopri8(7) added
5. radau added!! implicit runge kutta, solves also DAE up to index 3!
6. image function for ode.2-D added.
7. changed warning printing in FORTRAN code
8. common interface for radau and daspk:
   both can solve systems written as M*dy = f(x,y).
   dasp can also solve systems written as 0 = g(x,y,dy) (=default for daspk)

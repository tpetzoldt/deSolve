ToDo:

Events
======
- ODEPACK-solvers: done
- rk-Solvers: work in progress


NaN warnings and termination of R 
=================================
- KS does not see how this can be resolved


Delay differential equations 
============================
- The implementation in ddesolve is not very robust...


Runge-Kutta interpolation
=========================
- work in progress (ThPe)
  - "no interpolation" mode for rkAuto
  - to be impelemted for rkFixed

TODOs, Ideas/Wishes for future versions
================================================================================
Karline:

Thomas: 
- add timelags and root finding to Runge-Kutta solvers

Karline + Thomas: 
- issue with \itemize [\item] in value section of eventtimes

- add dopri 8(5,3) - Fortran??

- extend diagnostics: ?
  e.g. to return number of timesteps, number of ftion evaluations, etc...

- document rootfinding better

- plotting 1-D variable in 0-D model and so on.


Impossibilities...
==================
resolve NaN warnings and termination of R for all models specified by users
- KS does not see how this can be resolved

Delay differential equations in compiled code
- KS: not at all easy, and who will use that?!

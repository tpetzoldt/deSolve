<h3>Abstract</h3>

R has become the most widely used systems for statistical data
analysis, but it is also well suited for other disciplines in
scientific computing. One of the fields where considerable progress
has been made is the solution of differential equations. Package
deSolve provides the useR with state-of-the-art technology for
handling differential equations in R.

The tutorial will concentrate on solving initial value problems of
ordinary differential equations (ODE). We will give an overview over
the different solver functions available in packages deSolve and
rootSolve. Practical examples will show that even numerically
challenging systems can be efficiently solved in R and how external
data can be handled. An outlook will demonstrate how partial
differential equations (PDE) for reaction diffusion systems in 1D, 2D
or 3D can be handled in R and how impressive computation performance
can be approached.




<h3>Outline</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>How to specify a model:</strong> Differential equation
modelling made easy.</li>
<li><strong>Don't be afraid of stiffness:</strong> An overview over
the solver functions.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamics, chaos and equilibria:</strong> Plotting,
  scenario comparison and root finding.</li>
<li><strong>Under control:</strong> Forcing functions and events.</li>
<li><strong>Diffusion, advection and reaction:</strong> Partial differential
  equations (PDE) with ReacTran.</li>
<li><strong>R without handbrake:</strong> Using matrices and compiled
code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>It will be assumed that participants have good knowledge of the R
language and are familiar with ordinary differential equation models
in any discipline. At least basic knowledge about numerical simulation
methods would be helpful.</p>

<p>Preparatory material can be found on
 the <a href="http://desolve.r-forge.r-project.org/">deSolve web
 page</a>.</p>

<h3>Intended Audience</h3> 

<p>Differential equations can be used to describe exchanges of matter,
energy, information or any other quantities as they vary in time
and/or space.</p>

<p>We invite people with background in natural, environmental and life
sciences, as well as systems sciences, engineering, economics or any
other discipline to experience how nicely and flexibly R can be used
to explore time-dependend behavior of their dynamical systems.</p>

<p>Pre-conference discussion is possible on the mailig list:

deSolve release 2.0

KS added help file to explain forcings implementation in DLL - suggestion:
also include here how to use forcings in pure R code (approxfun)
DONE

Added zvode, working with complex numbers; not thoroughly tested. Especially 
working with DLL - to be tried. Vignette adapted.

daeSolve is rather unstable...


** To do **

- make possible to use banded solvers with compiled code (now only lsodes) KS
  KS->ThPe but lsodes is much more efficient than lsode (+- 20%
           however, there is the rwork problem....
  KS: low priority - VERY technical
- more diagnostics for rk  - ThPe (low priority, who will need
this...)

 

** Wishlist **

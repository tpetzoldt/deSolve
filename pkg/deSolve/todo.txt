TODOs:
======
Woody: fix Compiler "warning"

Thomas: add "timelags" (and "root finding"?) to runge-kuttas

Karline + Thomas: add dopri 8(5,3) - Fortran??


Ideas/wishes (ThPe/karline): 
======
Karline->Thomas: nesting of ode calls fails if run has been stopped (ESC); 
fix: karline removed it again... 

Karline, Thomas: timesteps should return NA if called outside of ODE

Impossibilities...
======
NaN warnings and termination of R 
- KS does not see how this can be resolved

Delay differential equations in compiled code 
- KS: not at all easy , and who will use that?! 

Changes version 1.8 Thomas:
==========================

dopri8(7) 
- coefficients use now common instead of decimal fractions


Changes version 1.8 Karline:
============================

Runge-kuttas: 
1. extra output: number of failed steps (see also 2)

2. number of function evaluations + 1 for initial condition

3. dense output for cash-karp

4. dopri8(7) added 

5. radau added!! implicit runge kutta, solves also DAE up to index 3!

6. image function for ode.2-D added.

7. changed warning printing in FORTRAN code

8. common interface for radau and daspk: 
   both can solve systems written as M*dy = f(x,y).
   dasp can also solve systems written as 0 = g(x,y,dy) (=default for daspk)

deSolve release 2.0

*** TO DO NOW ***


** done **
- code + doc for temporal interpolation in C and Fortran
- linear + constant interpolation
- interpolation options in a list - avoids growth of arguments..
  AND assure backward compatibility
- explain forcing options in compiledCode vignette
- Update vignette with diagnostics example
- S3 classes for deSolve output  (deSolve = class of differential equation)
- print and plot method for deSolve output (in file utilities.R)
- improve diagnostics for all    (note: NO S3 classes needed...)
- forcing functions for rk solvers
- simple PI stepsize control (not really important for our testcases)
- unscramble output names in case 1-D
- plot.deSolve asks user after each page of plots (default 3 x 3)

** in progress **
- make help files more readable
   * removed istate and rstate description from Rd files
     -> now in a TABLE in vignette



** To do **
- make possible to use banded solvers with compiled code (now only lsodes) KS
  KS->ThPe but lsodes is much more efficient than lsode (+- 20%
           however, there is the rwork problem....
           what do you think?
  KS: low priority - VERY technical
- more diagnostics for rk  - ThPe (low priority, who will need
this...)

- ThPe: more consistency of the .Rd help file examples:
  - rename lvmodel (because similar name as LVmod); --> SPK (substrate
  - producer, consumer) or SPC? or other suggestion???
 

** Wishlist **

Description: Functions that solve a system of first-order ordinary differential
             equations (ODE) and of differential algebraic equations (DAE).
             The functions provide an interface to the FORTRAN functions lsoda,
             lsodar, lsode, lsodes of the ODEPACK collection,
             to the FORTRAN functions dvode and daspk and a C-implementation of
             solvers of the Runge-Kutta family with fixed or variable time steps.
             The package also contains routines designed for solving ODEs
             resulting from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D partial differential equations
             (PDE) that have been converted to ODEs by numerical differencing.

deSolve release 2.0

** done **
- code + doc for temporal interpolation in C and Fortran - done
- linear + constant interpolation - done
- interpolation options in a list - avoids growth of arguments..
  AND assure backward compatibility - done
- explain forcing options in compiledCode vignette   - done
- Update vignette with diagnostics example - done
- S3 classes for DE output  (DE = differential equation) - done
- print method for DE output (done - in file ode.R)
- improve diagnostics for all    (note: NO S3 classes needed...)

** in progress **
- make help files more readable
   * removed istate and rstate description from Rd files
     -> now in a TABLE in vignette - but still needs to be checked

** to decide **
do we need:
- ? root extraction for lsodar or is "attributes(out)$iroot" enough?
- ? istate and rstate extraction for all?  or "attributes(out)$istate" ?
- ? write a plot.ode function ? (~ as in FME), multiple figures on a window

** To do **
- make possible to use banded solvers with compiled code (now only lsodes) KS
- more diagnostics for rk  - ThPe
- PID stepsize control for rk - ThPe
- unscramble output names in case 1-D model (see example Thomas !) - KS

** Wishlist **
- forcings and initfunc for R models too. -
  KS: difficult - what is the best strategy ?
    * compatible to forcing functions in DLL
    * compatible to approxfun, but not using bisectioning
- pass control parameters (KS: do not understand: time steps etc???)

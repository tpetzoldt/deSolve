TODOs:

Woody: fix Compiler "warning"
Karline: delay differential equations in compiled code + improved interval location
Thomas: add "timelags" to runge-kuttas


Done:

Miscellaneous
=============
KS: updated vignette with - events, delay differential equations.

Roots
=====
The fact that lsodar was the only solver with root finding, has been a nuisance
for a long time. It means one is forced to use lsoda, whereas in practice I 
usually use lsode or vode.

***** NEW *****
KS added root finding to lsode.

NOTE: the solver is still called "lsode" which is not entirely compatible with
  lsoda/lsodar... 
*******

ToDo: Thomas, it should be possible to add "root finding" also to the runge-kuttas.
You have the dense output/polynomial interpolation now; only need to add a
rootfinder (bisectioning). But is a lot of work....



Delay differential equations 
============================
- The implementation in ddesolve is not very robust...

***** NEW ******
  ... but it is often done this way (so I, KS, recently learnt)
so : KS -> added timelags, in ALL solvers but the runge-kuttas and zvode...
        -> added a new solver, called dede, to solve delay differential equations
        -> checked with matlab implementation - ok, R can do what matlab can,
           but the interface is somewhat simpler.

NOTE: name "dede" in order to avoid conflict with "dde" from ddesolve; suggestions?
*****
ToDo: 1. Thomas, it should be relatively simple to add "lags" also to the runge-kuttas.
      2. Karline: delay differential equations in compiled code (pfft)
      3. Karline: improved interpolation (finding interval)...
      
Events
======
- ODEPACK-solvers: done
- rk-Solvers: done


NaN warnings and termination of R 
=================================
ToDo: - KS does not see how this can be resolved


Runge-Kutta interpolation
=========================
  - "no interpolation" mode for rkAuto: done
  

mebdfi
======
ToDo: - To be added (ks) 

******
 KS: still in doubt whether deSolve is the correct place - it 
is a very complex solver.

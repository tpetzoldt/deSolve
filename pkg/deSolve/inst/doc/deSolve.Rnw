\Abstract{
  \R package \ds \citep{deSolve}, the successor of \proglang{R}
  package \pkg{odesolve} is a package to solve initial value problems (IVP) of:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item ordinary differential equations (ODE),
    \item differential algebraic equations (DAE) and
    \item partial differential equations (PDE).
  \end{itemize}

  The implementation includes stiff integration routines based on the
  ODEPACK Fortan codes \citep{Hindmarsh83}.  It also include
  Runge-Kutta solvers and the Euler method \citep{Press92}.

  In this vignette we outline how to implement differential equations
  as \R-functions.

  Another vignette ("compiledCode") \citep{compiledCode}, deals with
  differential equations implemented in lower-level languages such as
  \proglang{FORTRAN}, \proglang{C}, or \proglang{C++}, which are
  compiled into a dynamically linked library (DLL) and loaded into
  \proglang{R}.

\section{A simple ODE: chaos in the atmosphere}

  The Lorenz equations (Lorenz, 1963) were the first chaotic dynamic system
  to be described. They consist of three differential equations that were
  assumed to represent idealized behavior of the earth's atmosphere.
  We use this model to demonstrate how to implement and solve differential
  equations in \proglang{R}.
  The Lorenz model describes the dynamics of three state variables, $X$,
  $Y$ and $Z$.

  %ThPe: It would be nice to have one sentence about what these states are

  The model equations are:

  \[
    \begin{array}{l}
      \frac{{dX}}{{dt}} =  a \cdot X + Y \cdot Z \\
      \frac{{dY}}{{dt}} =  b \cdot (Y - Z) \\
      \frac{{dZ}}{{dt}} =  - X \cdot Y + c \cdot Y - Z \\
    \end{array}
  \]
  with the initial conditions:
  \[
    X(0) = Y(0) = Z(0) = 1
  \]

  Where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are three parameters, with values of -8/3, -10 and 28
  respectively.

  Implementation of an IVP ODE in \R can be separated in two parts: the model
  specification and the model application.

  Model specification consists of:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item	Defining model parameters and their values,
    \item	Defining model state variables and their initial conditions,
    \item	Implementing the model equations that calculate the rate of
      change (e.g. $dX/dt$) of the state variables.
  \end{itemize}

  The model application consists of
  \begin{itemize}
    \item	Specification of the time at which model output is wanted
    \item	Integration of the model equations (uses R-functions from \ds)
    \item	Plotting of model results.
  \end{itemize}

  Below, we discuss the \proglang{R}-code for the Lorenz model.

  \subsection{Model specification}

    1. Model parameters.

    There are three model parameters: $a$, $b$, and $c$ that are defined first.
    Parameters are stored as a vector with assigned names and values.

<<>>=
parameters <- c(a = -8/3,
                b = -10,
                c =  28)
@
    2. State variables.

    The three state variables are also created as a vector, and their
    initial values given.
<<>>=

state     <- c(X = 1,
               Y = 1,
               Z = 1)
@
    3. Model equations

    The model equations are specified in a function (\code{Lorenz}) that
    calculates the rate of change of the state variables. Input to the
    function is the model time (\code{t}, not used here, but required by
    the calling routine), and the values of the state variables (\code{state})
    and the parameters, in that order.

    This function will be called by the \R routine that solves the differential
    equations (here we use \code{ode}, see below).

    The code is most readable if we can address the parameters and state
    variables by their names.
    As both parameters and state variables are 'vectors', they are converted
    as a list. The statement \code{with(as.list(c(state,parameters)), {...})}
    then makes available the names of this list.

    The main part of the model calculates the rate of change of the state
    variables. At the end of the function, these rates of change are returned,
    packed as a list. Note that is necessary to return the rate of change in
    the same ordering as the specification of the state variables
    (this is very important).
    In this case, as state variables are specified $X$ first, then $Y$ and $Z$,
    the rates of changes are returned as $dX, dY, dZ$.

<<>>=
Lorenz<-function(t, state, parameters) {
 with(as.list(c(state, parameters)),{

    # rate of change
    dX <- a*X + Y*Z
    dY <- b * (Y-Z)
    dZ <- -X*Y + c*Y - Z

    # return the rate of change
    list(c(dX, dY, dZ))

    })   # end with(as.list...
  }
@

  \subsection{Model application}

  1. Time specification

  We run the model for 100 days, and give output at
  0.01 daily intervals. R's function \code{seq()} creates the time sequence.

<<>>=
times     <-seq(0,100,by=0.01)
@

  2. Model integration

  The model is solved using \ds function \code{ode}, which is the default
  integration routine.

  Function \code{ode} takes as input, a.o. the state variable vector (\code{y}),
  the times at which output is required (\code{times}), the model function
  that returns the rate of change (\code{func}) and the parameter vector
  (\code{parms}).

  Function \code{ode} returns a matrix that contains the values of the state
  variables (columns) at the requested output times. The output is converted
  to a data frame and stored in '\code{out}'.
  Data frames have the advantage, that their columns can be accessed by
  name, rather than by number. For instance, \code{out$X} will take the
  outputted values of state variable \code{X}, and so on.

  %ThPe: these are not concentrations; simply call them states

<<>>=
require(deSolve)
out <- as.data.frame(ode(y=state,times=times,func=Lorenz,parms=parameters))
head(out)
@

  3. Plotting results

  Finally, the model output is plotted.

  The figures are arranged in two rows and two columns (\code{mfrow}), and
  the size of the outer upper margin (the third margin) is increased
  (\code{oma}), such as to allow writing a figure heading (\code{mtext}).
  First the X concentration versus time is plotted, then the Y concentration
  versus time, and finally Y versus X and Z versus X.

  %ThPe: concentrations? states!

\end{figure}

\subsection{Solvers for initial value problems of ordinary differential
  equations}

  Package \ds contains several IVP ordinary differential equation solvers.
  They can all be triggered from function \code{ode} (by setting the argument
  \code{method}), or can be run as stand-alone functions.

  Moreover, for each integration routine, several options are available to
  optimise performance.

  Thus it should be possible to find, for one particular problem, the most
  efficient solver.
  See \citep{deSolve} for more information about when to use which solver
  in \pkg{deSolve}. For most cases, the default solver, \code{ode} and using the
  default settings will do.
  Table 1 gives a short overview of the available methods.

  We solve the model with several integration routines, each time
  printing the time it took (in seconds) to find the solution.

<<>>=
print(system.time(out <-rk4   (state,times,Lorenz,parameters)))
print(system.time(out <-lsode (state,times,Lorenz,parameters)))
print(system.time(out <-lsoda (state,times,Lorenz,parameters)))
print(system.time(out <-lsodes(state,times,Lorenz,parameters)))
print(system.time(out <-daspk (state,times,Lorenz,parameters)))
print(system.time(out <-vode  (state,times,Lorenz,parameters)))
@

\section{Partial differential equations}

  As package \ds includes integrators that deal efficiently with
  arbitrarily sparse and banded Jacobians, it is especially well
  suited to solve initial value problems resulting from 1, 2 or
  3-dimensional partial differential equations (PDE). These are first
  written as ODEs using the method-of-lines approach.

  Three special-purpose solvers are included in \ds:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \code{ode.band} integrates 1-dimensional problems comprizing one species,
    \item \code{ode.1D} integrates 1-dimensional problems comprizing many species,
    \item \code{ode.2D} integrates 2-dimensional problems,
    \item \code{ode.2D} integrates 2-dimensional problems.
  \end{itemize}

    As an example, consider the Aphid model described in \citet{Soetaert08}.

  It is a model where aphids slowly diffuse and grow on a row of plants.
  The model equations are:
  \[
    \frac{{\partial N}}{{\partial t}} =  - \frac{{\partial Flux}}{{\partial {\kern 1pt} x}} + g \cdot N
  \]
  and where the diffusive flux is given by:
  \[
    Flux_{diffusion}  =  - D\frac{{\partial N}}{{\partial {\kern 1pt} x}}
  \]

  with boundary conditions
  \[
    N_{x=0}=N_{x=60}=0
  \]
  and initial condition

  $N_x=0$ for $x \neq 30$

  $N_x=1$ for $x = 30$

  In the method of lines approach, the spatial domain is subdivided in a
  number of boxes and the equation is discretized as:
  \[
    \frac{{dN_i }}{{dt}} =   - \frac{{Flux_{i,i + 1}  - Flux_{i - 1,i} }}{{\Delta x_i }} + g \cdot N_i
  \]
  with the flux on the interface equal to:
  \[
    Flux_{i - 1,i}  =  - D_{i - 1,i}  \cdot \frac{{N_i  - N_{i - 1} }}{{\Delta x_{i - 1,i} }}
  \]
  Note that the values of state variables (here densities) are defined in the
  centre of boxes (i), whereas the fluxes are defined on the box interfaces.

  We refer to \citet{Soetaert08} for more information about this model and
  its numerical approximation.

  Here is its implementation in \proglang{R}:

  First the model equations are defined:
<<>>=
  Aphid <- function(t,APHIDS,parameters)
   {
      deltax     <- c (0.5, rep(1,numboxes-1), 0.5)
      Flux       <- -D * diff(c(0, APHIDS, 0)) /deltax
      dAPHIDS    <- -diff(Flux) / delx  + APHIDS*r

      # the return value
        list(dAPHIDS )
    }  # end
@
  Then the model parameters and spatial grid are defined
<<>>=
  D         <- 0.3    # m2/day  diffusion rate
  r         <- 0.01   # /day    net growth rate
  delx      <- 1      # m       thickness of boxes
  numboxes  <- 60

  # distance of boxes on plant, m, 1 m intervals
  Distance  <- seq(from=0.5, by=delx, length.out=numboxes)
@
  Aphids are initially only present in two central boxes:
<<>>=
  # Initial conditions:  # ind/m2
  APHIDS        <- rep(0, times=numboxes)
  APHIDS[30:31] <- 1
  state         <- c(APHIDS=APHIDS)      # initialise state variables
@
  The model is run for 200 days, producing output every day; the time
  elapsed in seconds to solve this 60 state-variable model
  is estimated (\code{system.time})
<<>>=
  times     <-seq(0,200,by=1)
  print(system.time(
    out       <- ode.band(state,times,Aphid,parms=0,nspec=1)
  ))
@
matrix 'out' consist of times (1st column) followed by the densities (next
columns)
<<>>=
  head (out[,1:5])
  DENSITY   <- out[,2:(numboxes  +1)]
@
  Finally, the output is plotted
<<label=aphid, include=FALSE>>=
  filled.contour(x=times, y=Distance, DENSITY, color= topo.colors,
                 xlab="time, days", ylab= "Distance on plant, m",
                 main="Aphid density on a row of plants")
@

\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.8\textwidth}

<<aphid>>
@
\end{center}
\caption{Solution of the 1-dimensional aphid model - see text for \R-code}
\label{fig:aphid}
\end{figure}

  As the 1-D model describes only one species, it is best solved with
  \ds function \code{ode.band}.

  A multi-species IVP example can be found in \citet{Soetaert08b}.

  For 2-D problems, we refer to the help-files of function \code{ode.2D}.

  \section{Differential algebraic equations}

  Function \code{daspk} from package \ds solves (relatively simple)
  DAEs of index\footnote{note that many -apparently simple-
  DAEs are higher-index DAEs} maximal 1.

  The DAE has to be specified by the \emph{residual function} instead of
  the rates of change (as in ODE).

  Consider the following simple DAE:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dy_1}{dt}&=&-y_1+y_2\\
y_1 \cdot y_2 &=& t
\end{eqnarray*}

  where the first equation is a differential, the second an algebraic equation.

  To solve it, it is first rewritten as residual functions:

\begin{eqnarray*}
0&=&\frac{dy_1}{dt}+y_1-y_2\\
0&=&y_1 \cdot y_2 - t
\end{eqnarray*}

  In \R we write:
<<>>=
daefun<-function(t,y,dy,parameters)
 {
       res1  <- dy[1]+y[1]-y[2]
       res2  <- y[2]*y[1]-t

    list(c(res1,res2))
 }
require(deSolve)

yini  <- c(1,0)
dyini <- c(1,0)
times <-seq(0,10,0.1)

# solver
print(system.time(out <-daspk(y=yini,dy=dyini,times=times,res=daefun,parms=0)))

\section{Using the integration options}
The solvers from the ODEPACK integration routines can be optimised if it
is known whether the problem is stiff or non-stiff, or if the
structure of the Jacobian is sparse. We repeat the example from \code{lsode}
to show how we can make good use of these options.

The model describes the time evolution of 5 state variables:
<<>>=
f1 <- function  (t, y, parms)
{
  ydot <- vector(len = 5)

  ydot[1] <-  0.1*y[1] -0.2*y[2]
  ydot[2] <- -0.3*y[1] +0.1*y[2] -0.2*y[3]
  ydot[3] <-           -0.3*y[2] +0.1*y[3] -0.2*y[4]
  ydot[4] <-                     -0.3*y[3] +0.1*y[4] -0.2*y[5]
  ydot[5] <-                               -0.3*y[4] +0.1*y[5]

  return(list(ydot))
}
@
and the initial conditions and output times are:
<<>>=
yini  <- 1:5
times <- 1:20
@
The default solution, using \code{lsode} assumes that the model is stiff,
and the integrator generates the Jacobian, which is assummed to be \emph{full}:
<<>>=
out   <- lsode(yini, times, f1, parms = 0, jactype = "fullint")
@

It is possible for the user to provide the Jacobian. Especially for large
problems this can result in subtantial time savingsL

In a first case, the Jacobian is written as a full matrix:
<<>>=
fulljac <- function  (t, y, parms)
{
   jac <- matrix(nrow = 5, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE,
                data = c(0.1, -0.2,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,
                        -0.3,  0.1, -0.2,  0  ,  0  ,
                         0  , -0.3,  0.1, -0.2,  0  ,
                         0  ,  0  , -0.3,  0.1, -0.2,
                         0  ,  0  ,  0  , -0.3,  0.1)    )
   return(jac)
}
@
and the model solved as:
<<>>=
out2  <- lsode(yini, times, f1, parms = 0, jactype = "fullusr",
              jacfunc = fulljac)
@
The Jacobian matrix is banded, with
 one nonzero band above (up) and one below(down) the diagonal:

First we let \code{lsode} to estimate the banded Jacobian internally
(\code{jactype="bandint"}):
<<>>=
out3  <- lsode(yini, times, f1, parms = 0, jactype = "bandint",
                              bandup = 1, banddown = 1)
@

It is also possible to provide the nonzero bands of the Jacobian in a function:
<<>>=
bandjac <- function  (t, y, parms)
{
   jac <- matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE,
                 data = c( 0  , -0.2, -0.2, -0.2, -0.2,
                           0.1,  0.1,  0.1,  0.1,  0.1,
                          -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3,    0)    )
   return(jac)
}
@
in which case the model is solved as:
<<>>=
out4  <- lsode(yini, times, f1, parms = 0, jactype = "bandusr",
              jacfunc = bandjac, bandup = 1, banddown = 1)
@
Finally, if the model is specified as a "non-stiff"  (by setting \code{mf=10}),
there is no need to specify the Jacobian.
<<>>=
out5  <- lsode(yini, times, f1, parms = 0, mf = 10)
@
\clearpage

\section{A warning}

The solvers from ODEPACK should be first choice for any problem. However,
there are cases where they give very dubious results.

Consider the following Lotka-Volterra type of model:

<<>>=
lvmodel <- function(t, x, parms)  {
  with(as.list(c(parms, x)), {
    dP <- c*P  - d*K*P          # producer
    dK <- e*P*K  - f*K          # consumer
    res <- c(dP, dK)
    list(res)
  })
}
@

and with the following (biologically not very realistic)%
\footnote{they are not realistic because producers grow unlimited with
  a high rate and consumers with 100 \% efficiency} parameter values:

<<>>=
parms  <- c(c = 5, d = 0.1, e = 0.1, f = 0.1)
@

After specification of the initial conditions and the output times, the
model is solved - using \code{lsoda}, and output plotted.

<<>>=
xstart <- c(P = 0.5, K = 1)
times  <- seq(0, 190, 0.1)

out <- as.data.frame( ode(y = xstart,times = times,
  func = lvmodel, parms = parms))
tail(out)
@

At the end of the simulation, both producers and consumer values are
Not-A-Numbers!

What has happened? Being an implicit method, \code{lsoda} generates very small
negative values for producers, from day 40 on; these negative values, small
at first grow in magnitude until they become NaNs.

This is because the model equations are not intended to be used with
negative numbers, as negative concentrations are not realistic.

A quick-and-dirty solution is to reduce the maximum time step to a
considerably small value which, of course, reduces computational
efficiency:

<<>>=
out <- as.data.frame(ode(y = xstart,times = times,  hmax=0.02,
  func = lvmodel, parms = parms))
matplot(out[,1], out[,2:3], type="l")
@

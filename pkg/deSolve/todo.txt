================================================================================
TODOs, Ideas/Wishes for future versions
================================================================================

Karline:
- check reverted time vector for Livermore solvers

Thomas:
- allow events in R for models in compiled code
- add timelags and root finding to Runge-Kutta solvers
- allow reverted time vector for dense output methods

Karline + Thomas: 

- add dopri 8(5,3) - Fortran??

- extend diagnostics: ?
  e.g. to return number of timesteps, number of ftion evaluations, etc...

- document rootfinding better

- plotting 1-D variable in 0-D model and so on.


Impossibilities...
==================
resolve NaN warnings and termination of R for all models specified by users
- KS does not see how this can be resolved

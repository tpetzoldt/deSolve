TODOs:
======

Woody: fix Compiler "warning"

Karline: delay differential equations in compiled code + 
  higher-order interpolation (using bdf coefficients)

Thomas: add "timelags" (and "root finding"?) to runge-kuttas

Karline + Thomas: add dopri 8(5,3 ) - fortran??

Karline: allow nesting of ode calls; use save/restore_N_Protect


Ideas/wishes (ThPe): 

Thomas: dopri8(7): use common instead of decimal fractions

Karline, Thomas: timesteps should return NA if called outside of ODE



NaN warnings and termination of R 
- KS does not see how this can be resolved



Changes version 1.8 Karline:
============================

Runge-kuttas: 
1. extra output: number of failed steps (see also 2)

2. number of function evaluations + 1 for initial condition, 
  and account for failed steps if dense output (1st step always "rejected").
  Note: by keeping a copy of the last accepted step, a new ftion evaluation
  may not be necessary in case the step was rejected
  -> but take into account first step (it=1): where accept is always FALSE, 
  yet a copy does not exist.

    if (fsal && accept){
      j1 = 1;
      for (i = 0; i < neq; i++) FF[i] = FF[i + neq * (stage - 1)];
      for (i = 0; i < neq; i++) Fcopy[i] = FF[i];

    else if (fsal && it >1 ){
      j1 = 0;
      for (i = 0; i < neq; i++) FF[i] = Fcopy[i];
    } else {
      j1 = 0;
    }

3. dense output for cash-karp

4. dopri8(7) added
